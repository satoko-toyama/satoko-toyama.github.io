## Research Focus

My research focuses on developing a novel technique to directly observe and quantify electromagnetic fields using Differential Phase Contrast (DPC) in Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM). With the miniaturization of electronic and spintronic devices, there is an increasing need to characterize nanoscale electromagnetic field distributions. However, conventional methods lack the necessary spatial resolution for such measurements.

I utilize a specialized detector in STEM's bright-field mode to measure electron beam deflections caused by electromagnetic fields within materials. By analyzing these deflections, I can create high-resolution maps of internal electric fields. I have successfully applied this technique to various systems, including semiconductor p-n junctions, GaN heterointerfaces, oxide grain boundaries, and magnetic memory devices, demonstrating its broad applicability in materials science research.
